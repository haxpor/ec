# Commands Available

* `npm run build` - support only on *nix, and macOS system as it uses system commands to do the task.

# Issues

* `react-weui` is broken and now it uses [forked](https://github.com/haxpor/react-weui/commit/d38636cf39b1b299fadcb376263926052fd85281) version of fixing Grid when link to `react-router`'s URL with setting of local directory as dependency in NPM's `package.json`. This limits the ability to do CI. We have to wait until the author merge and publish onto NPM registry.
